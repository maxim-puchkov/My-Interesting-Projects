## SDN Simulation
__Python__ implementation of a __Mininet__ Software-Defined Network. The SDN Controller is programmed to determine the shortest path between each pair of switches using Dijkstra's least-cost paths algorithm. Using simulation's Command Line Interface, user can monitor simulated traffic with standard tools such as `tcpdump` and `wireshark`. Additionally, user may enter customized commands (`ifconfigs`, `arps`, `netstats`, etc.) to view interface configuration and other related data for all hosts.
